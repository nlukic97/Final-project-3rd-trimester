# Extra notes
## 1. Frontend project
- reads for a cookie every time a view is loaded, and creates a cookie when the "accept cookies" prompt is confirmed - stopping the prompt from appearing when loading a new view.
- has a custom 404 page
## 2. Backend project
- has mandatory image uploads when creating a new item. However, it has optional image changing when editing an item. Uploading a new item image will delete the old item's image.
- has a custom 404 page
